    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        So what I talked about is that The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939. It began in the U.S. after the stock market crash in October 1929. Since the U.S. was the world's largest economy, other countries like the UK and Germany also struggled. Before the Depression, the 1920s, known as the "Roaring Twenties," was a time of economic growth, but it caused inequality, with the rich getting richer and the poor staying the same. Banks gave out risky loans, leading to debt. After the crash, unemployment reached 25%, many farmers lost their land, and half the country’s banks failed. President Hoover didn't do enough, so Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 election and introduced the New Deal to help the economy. Some reasons for why I used the audio's that I used is because the music was popular around the time of the Great Depression—the three biggest ones were Jazz, Blues, and Swing.</p>

    <h2>Video Essay (Project 2)</h2>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        In this essay, I talk about how the behind-the-scenes choices filmmakers make—like how a scene is filmed, how fast or slow the story moves, and how music and sound are used—affect how we feel while watching a TV show or movie. These choices can make us feel excited, scared, sad, or happy. I wanted to show that these decisions are just as important as the story itself, and understanding them can help us enjoy shows more. If I were making a video essay, I would use clips from shows like Breaking Bad and The Witcher to show how the camera, pacing, and sound affect the mood of a scene. This would help people see how these choices work in action, making my points easier to understand. A video essay would let me show exactly how filmmakers make us feel different things. While writing this essay, I learned a lot about filmmaking techniques, especially how pacing and sound are used to build tension. I also learned how to use Premiere Pro to edit and organize a video essay. This helped me figure out how to present my ideas in a clear and interesting way. Feedback from my classmates really helped improve my essay. It made me focus more on examples and helped me make my ideas easier to understand. The suggestions I got helped me make my argument stronger and the essay more organized. Overall, the feedback made my final project better and easier for people to enjoy.</p>
